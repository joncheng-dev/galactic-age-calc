## Description

This is my week 5 individual project for Epicodus. I use modern development environments -- managing dependencies with node packaging manager, and webpack to lint, bundle, and process code. Focused in this project is the use of classes introduced in JavaScript ES6 as well as using Jest to practice Test Driven Development (TDD) with 100% coverage. I use methods to update properties of instances of classes. Also focused on is separation of concerns: e.g. utility functions grouped together; classes and their methods grouped together in their own files.
